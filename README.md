## Welcome to my profile (Sam John)

My name is Sam John and my student number is s3795053. I was born in Geelong, Australia in Geelong hospital. Soon after I was born I
moved to Tasmania to live near Hobart until I was eight years old. My parents eventually realised how cold the little island actually
was and decided to move back to Geelong where I have lived ever since. I went on to finish V.C.E at Bellarine secondary college which is
located on the Bellarine peninsula. I then went on to study an advanced diploma of computer systems engineering dropping out halfway
through being consumed by the party scene as an impressionable newbie adult. Once I regathered my footings on reality I decided to study
sound engineering completing it in the year of 2015. I learnt a lot from my studies but was unable to find a job as the music industry
is a tough chestnut to crack. I then went on to study commercial cookery and after two years of study decided it wasn’t for me. I am
still currently working in the hospitality sector but hopefully not for much longer. After much deliberation and a few stressful months
I decided to do what I love, computers. 
My interest in I.T started at a young age. My parents bought me a computer when I was around 10 years old. Don’t think I’ve had a
happier moment since that brick of a thing got setup in my room. I love gaming and will always. I almost find myself wondering how the
code is written for a certain mechanic in a game more than I just enjoy the mechanic. I want to know what goes on behind the scenes. How
they build each element from the ground up. How their creative juices have an impact on the progression of these things and how I can
make it better once I have learned the fundamentals. It’s not just the gaming industry that I want to lift the curtain off. I also have
recently gained a heavy interest in the cyber security side of things. Being in charge of protecting a business from outside virtual
intruders sounds exciting to say the least. Having my counter measures broken only to add a new line of defence sounds new and
inventive.
