## Welcome to my profile (Sam John)

My name is Sam John and my student number is s3795053. I was born in Geelong, Australia in Geelong hospital. Soon after I was born I
moved to Tasmania to live near Hobart until I was eight years old. My parents eventually realised how cold the little island actually
was and decided to move back to Geelong where I have lived ever since. I went on to finish V.C.E at Bellarine secondary college which is
located on the Bellarine peninsula. I then went on to study an advanced diploma of computer systems engineering dropping out halfway
through being consumed by the party scene as an impressionable newbie adult. Once I regathered my footings on reality I decided to study
sound engineering completing it in the year of 2015. I learnt a lot from my studies but was unable to find a job as the music industry
is a tough chestnut to crack. I then went on to study commercial cookery and after two years of study decided it wasn’t for me. I am
still currently working in the hospitality sector but hopefully not for much longer. After much deliberation and a few stressful months
I decided to do what I love, computers.
 
My interest in I.T started at a young age. My parents bought me a computer when I was around 10 years old. Don’t think I’ve had a
happier moment since that brick of a thing got setup in my room. I love gaming and will always. I almost find myself wondering how the
code is written for a certain mechanic in a game more than I just enjoy the mechanic. I want to know what goes on behind the scenes. How
they build each element from the ground up. How their creative juices have an impact on the progression of these things and how I can
make it better once I have learned the fundamentals. It’s not just the gaming industry that I want to lift the curtain off. I also have
recently gained a heavy interest in the cyber security side of things. Being in charge of protecting a business from outside virtual
intruders sounds exciting to say the least. Having my counter measures broken only to add a new line of defence sounds new and
inventive. 


### Senior Cyber security analyst

https://www.seek.com.au/job/38567519?searchrequesttoken=6fd8a6fe-8a2a-4eb9-9e6d-2524ed08acf4&type=standard

This position is working for a bank protecting their data and making sure everything runs smoothly without interruptions and/or breaches to the system. The senior cyber security analyst would have a direct overview of all event logs to assist with the eventuation of a problem. Being able to access these logs keeps them up to date and allows them to back track through the data should a problem arise to find the solution. If there are any security breaches or any system errors/faults this staff member would have direct contact to the problem providing assistance and direct attempts to solve the issue. My limited knowledge about this position tells me that it is a creative problem solving based position that is ever evolving and kept exciting. Whilst enjoying previously stated characteristics my favorite part is the learning curve involved, I could never know everything which would leave constant room for improvement.

To successfully enter into this position I believe I would need to have at least an undergraduate degree in cyber security and five years experience in the area. On top of these qualifications I would need to do constant research in my own time to keep up on new trends and mechanics emerging within the industry so I don’t get blind sided whilst protecting someone else data.

I currently only have a advanced diploma of sound engineering which would not apply to the industry. However I have been a computer enthusiast since I was 10 years old. I am a fast learner and having a direct interest in the field will prove a lot easier to gain the skills needed to be successful.

To gain these needed skills and qualifications I will do the following. Complete a degree in cyber security. Get a low level job in the area and continue independent study at home whilst learning as much as I can from the acquired job.
### Results from tests
 
16 personalities test – Mediator type.

Education planner learning styles test. Auditory learner

Test my creativity – Score is 64.28

The results to these tests were somewhat surprising. I always thought I was a little more creative than these said. It is nice to know that I am a mediator type. Able to see both sides of the argument could prove to be useful in certain situations.

I think knowing that I am an auditory learner and that I am more of a listener is helpful knowledge. This will help me to be mindful of staying in the productive space within the group as oppose to trying to take control. 

###Project Idea
Since I heard the week 1 podcast I was infatuated with the idea of programming a raspberry pi for this project. After talking to a few of the other students and having the knowledge of commercial kitchens we came up with the idea of setting up a raspberry pi inside the cool room and the several fridges that would be located around said commercial kitchen. It would then relay the temperature to a device within the head chefs possession auto filling In the daily temperature checking. Could also integrate some sort of very simple stock take system on specific items, having the raspberry pi know when said items have left the cool room and need to be replaced.

I have been working in kitchens for almost ten years now and have only ever seen one system mildly similar to this. When I asked about this system and how much it cost to set up the answer was unsettling. This raspberry pi alternative will be a much cheaper and much more accessible alternative to the latter.

As I stated in the first paragraph the raspberry pi will be hooked up to a thermocouple and will take temperatures by sitting within the cool room/freezer and reporting back the temps at a scheduled time. They will also act as a counter measure towards any of the cool rooms shutting down. Once the temperature in these cool rooms starts to go below the threshold eg. 6 degrees below recommended temperature it will send a warning notification to the head chef so that he can sort out the issue before it becomes worse. Simple straight forward idea that could be mass produced and sold at a low price. 

To achieve this I will utilize the technology of the raspberry pi coupled with a thermometer that suits. I believe the way I would program the raspberry pi would be done using the python.py language. So to fully achieve this I will have to train myself in the python language. Also I will be going to a seminar on the 23rd in Melbourne explaining how raspberry pi’s work, what they can do and how to utilize their technology efficiently. 

Once this project has been successfully completed the industry will have a cheap fast efficient way of taking the temperatures in cool rooms. Will nullify the need for hard copy temperature logs and will save time for the preparation and serving of food.
